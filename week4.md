# Week 4

### Overview
*Created a block diagram for how the subsystems will interact and we decided that our three high level requirements are:

Food containment unit is initially locked. Once specified 4 digit codes are inputted into the keypad of the containment unit, the containment unit will unlock.

A 4 digit code is randomly generated upon weight sensor activation. This randomly generated code is intended for 1 time use.

Once the weight sensor detects that the food has been placed inside the containment unit, the unit will lock.*
