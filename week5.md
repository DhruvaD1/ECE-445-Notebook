# Week 4

### Overview
*Started making the schematic for the PCB

Presented the proposal to TA's and professor

Started making changes that were reccomended by the TA's and professor for the design*

### Planning

![Week 5 Schematic Rough Draft](week5schematic.png)

This is a rough draft of our block diagram that we will improve on when writing the proposal.

We have also found parts that we might use in the PCB here is a link to it https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWdd_iKvCoWNnZnPi8gho3ebCUdIYqPdJ7taNgwGFWw/edit?tab=t.0

All of these parts are ones we might use, but we have to do more research on what exactly is needed.

We have also learned that we need to use a wall plug with an AC to DC converter to power the whole PCB because of the heating
